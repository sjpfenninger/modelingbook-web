					<h4>Critical Transitions in Nature and Society <small>by Marten Scheffer</small></h4>
		            <p>Marten Scheffer delves deep into the fascinating topic of critical transitions (or tipping points), focusing primarily on natural systems but touching on their implications in human systems as well. Scheffer does pioneering work on understanding and predicting these transitions, and this book serves as a great introduction to the topic.</p>

					<h4>Modeling the Environment (2<sup>nd</sup> Edition) <small>by Andrew Ford</small></h4>
		            <p>Focuses on systems dynamics models in particular, i.e. models that operate with stocks and flows. Therefore there is some overlap with our box models. Introduces the <a href="http://www.iseesystems.com/softwares/Education/StellaSoftware.aspx">STELLA modeling software</a> (a commercial tool), so if you are looking for resources to learn STELLA, this book may be worth a try.</p>
